### Description
The purpose of this project is to provide a safe and convenient tool that helps Non-CS users build a web site.
There are numerous excellent content management systems, however, most of them are Web applications including database support.
Therefore, it would be difficult to prevent some hacking due to the bugs of web applications.
The system is inspired by static site generators, which is a text engine that produces static HTML web pages. Without the server-side programming and database, the web sites could be much safer and faster.
