### Description
The purpose of this project is to provide a safe and convenient tool that helps Non-CS users build a web site.
There are numerous excellent content management systems, however, most of them are Web applications which are at risks of hacking attacks.
Therefore, the system inspired by static site generators, which is a text engine that produces static HTML web pages, combines with the advantages of existing content management systems and static site generators to help non-CS users to create a static Web site without attacking threats.
